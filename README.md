## About The Project

eCommerce Rewards is a project that was designed to allow a company employees to be able to use points accrued through time worked to make merchandise purchases.

Here is a high-level breakdown of the design workflow:
* Employee at Amazing Company submits a weekly timesheet for hours worked. Let's call employee Arya
* Amazing Company payroll department processes timesheets once a week and generates a company employee report showing, all employee names, hours worked and payroll week ending date.
* Amazing Company payroll then logs in to eCommerce Rewards and uploads generated timesheet report
* eCommerce Rewards creates a customer record for every employee like Arya
* Platform then awards points (1 point for each hour worked) to Arya's customer account
* Arya can now login in to eCommerce Rewards using her email and phone #
* Once Arya is logged in, she can purchase merchandise using customer points accrued
